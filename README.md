# AirClaw Desktop Releases

Welcome to the official repository for AirClaw Desktop releases! This application allows users to connect to the internet securely and privately, leveraging the decentralized node infrastructure supported by our community.

## What is AirClaw?

AirClaw is a decentralized VPN application that incentivizes users to host nodes, paying them based on data usage while ensuring privacy and security in internet access. By using AirClaw, you contribute to and benefit from a community-driven network where VPN tokens are used to manage access and compensate node providers.
